# Introduction
The Smart Gas Safety System is designed to address the critical issue of detecting hazardous gas leaks, specifically carbon monoxide and methane, in both residential and industrial settings. Gas leaks pose significant health and safety risks as they are often undetectable by smell or sight, leading to potential poisoning, explosions, and fires. Our system employs advanced gas sensors (MQ-4 and MQ-7) and the ESP8266 microcontroller to ensure timely detection and real-time alerts through TWILIO API module. In addition to alerting residents, the system automatically activates ventilation systems using servo or stepper motors to mitigate immediate risks. For enhanced safety, a pneumatic solenoid valve is incorporated for master shutdown to stop further gas leakage. This comprehensive solution offers a modern approach to gas safety, protecting occupants and property from potential gas-related incidents.
