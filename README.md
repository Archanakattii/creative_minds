# SMART GAS SAFETY SYSTEM : DETECTING GAS LEAKS FOR SAFER HOMES AND INDUSTRIES

# Introduction
The history of gas leak detection systems dates back to the early 20th century when rudimentary methods, such as canaries in coal mines, were used to detect toxic gases. Over time, technology advanced, leading to the development of electronic sensors capable of detecting various hazardous gases. The introduction of microcontrollers and wireless communication modules further enhanced these systems, allowing for real-time monitoring and automated responses. The Smart Gas Safety System is a modern iteration of these advancements, designed to address the critical issue of detecting hazardous gas leaks, specifically carbon monoxide and methane, in industrial and residential settings. Using advanced MQ-4 and MQ-7 gas sensors and the ESP8266 microcontroller, the system provides timely detection and real-time alerts via the TWILIO API module. It also automates safety measures by activating ventilation systems with servo or stepper motors and employs a pneumatic solenoid valve for master shutdown, ensuring comprehensive protection against gas-related incidents.</p>

# Working Code
The system is divided into two parts:</p>
1.Publisher module</p>
2.Subscriber module</p>
**Here MQTT acts as a broker</p>**

    const char* password = "********";   //dummy wifi credientials

    PubSubClient client(espClient);
    
    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(115200);
    
      // Connect to WiFi
      setup_wifi();
      
      // Initialize MQTT
      client.setServer(mqtt_server, 1883);
    
      // Wait for connection
      while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        delay(500);
        Serial.print(".");
      }
      Serial.println("WiFi connected");
    
      delay(100);
    }
    
    void setup_wifi() {
      delay(10);
      Serial.println();

      WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
    
      while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        delay(500);
        Serial.print(".");
      }
    
      Serial.println("");
      Serial.println("WiFi connected");
      Serial.println("IP address: ");
      Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
    }
    
    void reconnect() {
      while (!client.connected()) {
        Serial.print("Attempting MQTT connection...");
        if (client.connect("ESP8266ClientPublisher")) {
          Serial.println("connected");
        } else {
          Serial.print("failed, rc=");
          Serial.print(client.state());
          Serial.println(" try again in 5 seconds");
          delay(5000);
        }
      }
    }
    
    void loop() {
      if (!client.connected()) {
        reconnect();
      }
      client.loop();
    
      int gasValue = analogRead(GAS_SENSOR_PIN);
      Serial.print("Gas Value: ");
      Serial.println(gasValue);
      
      if (gasValue > 350) { // Adjust threshold as necessary
        client.publish(topic, "leak");
      } else {
        client.publish(topic, "safe");
      }
    
      delay(2000); // Publish data every 2 seconds
    }
This code runs on an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect gas leaks and publish the sensor data to an MQTT broker. It connects to a specified WiFi network using the provided SSID and password, and sets up communication with an MQTT broker at "broker.hivemq.com" on the topic "home/gasLeak." The gas sensor is connected to the analog pin A0. </p>

In the `setup()` function, the code initializes serial communication, connects to the WiFi network, and sets the MQTT server. It waits for the WiFi connection to be established, indicated by printing dots in the serial monitor. The `setup_wifi()` function handles the WiFi connection process and prints the connection status and IP address once connected. </p>

The `reconnect()` function ensures that the ESP8266 reconnects to the MQTT broker if the connection is lost, printing the connection status to the serial monitor. In the `loop()` function, the code continuously checks the MQTT connection and reconnects if necessary. It reads the gas sensor value from the analog pin and prints it to the serial monitor. Based on the gas sensor value, it publishes a message to the MQTT topic indicating either "leak" if the value exceeds a threshold of 350, or "safe" if it does not. The data is published every 2 seconds.</p>

This code runs on an ESP8266 microcontroller to detect gas leaks, control a servo motor and relay based on the leak status, and make a phone call using the Twilio API when a leak is detected. It connects to a WiFi network using provided credentials and communicates with an MQTT broker at "broker.hivemq.com" on the topic "home/gasLeak." The servo motor is connected to pin D0, and the relay is connected to pin D1. The servo starts at 0 degrees, and the relay is initially off. </p>

The `setup()` function initializes serial communication, connects to WiFi using `setup_wifi()`, sets the MQTT server and callback function, and initializes the servo and relay. The `setup_wifi()` function handles the WiFi connection process and prints the connection status and IP address. The `reconnect()` function ensures that the ESP8266 reconnects to the MQTT broker if the connection is lost and subscribes to the topic.</p>

In the `loop()` function, the code continuously checks the MQTT connection and reconnects if necessary. The `callback()` function handles incoming MQTT messages. If a "leak" message is received, it turns off the relay, sets the servo to 180 degrees, and calls the `makeTwilioCall()` function to make a phone call using Twilio. If a "safe" message is received, it turns on the relay and sets the servo to 0 degrees. The `makeTwilioCall()` function makes an HTTP POST request to the Twilio API to initiate a phone call, using base64-encoded Twilio credentials for authentication.</p>

The gas leak detection system prototype functions through a series of coordinated steps to ensure safety. The MQ-2 gas sensor continuously monitors the environment for hazardous gases, sending data to the ESP8266 microcontroller. Upon detecting a gas concentration above a set threshold, the ESP8266 processes this data and uses its Wi-Fi connectivity to publish a "leak" status message via the MQTT protocol to a broker. Automated safety measures are then triggered: a pneumatic solenoid valve shuts off the gas supply to prevent further leakage, while a servo motor opens windows for ventilation. The ESP8266 also makes HTTP requests to Twilio's API, triggering calls to alert occupants about the gas leak. For safety during testing, smoke is used instead of LPG gas. The system maintains continuous monitoring, adjusting the safety mechanisms and maintaining MQTT connectivity for real-time updates, thereby providing a comprehensive and proactive approach to gas leak detection and response.
